# Quick Scan Instructions (OpenVAS / Nessus)

## OpenVAS (GVM) quick notes
- On Kali, you can install Greenbone packages or use the GVM setup script.
- Start the gvm services (commands vary by distro/setup). Then open the web UI (usually https://localhost:9392 or https://127.0.0.1:9392).
- Create a target using your local IP (for example: 10.188.202.130).
- Create a new Task > Select a scan config (Full and fast) > Run the task.
- After completion, go to the report and export as PDF/HTML.

## Nessus Essentials quick notes
- Register for Nessus Essentials to receive an activation code from Tenable.
- Install Nessus and activate with the code.
- Open the Nessus UI (https://localhost:8834) and create a new scan -> Advanced Scan or Basic Network Scan.
- Set target to your machine IP or localhost and launch.
- Export the report when done.

## Saving results
- Save exported report to `reports/` (create that folder).
- Save screenshots of the findings to `screenshots/`.

## Troubleshooting
- If scanner shows many false positives, cross-check with vendor advisories and CVE references.
- Ensure scanner plugins/feeds are up-to-date before running a full scan.
